# Operations-with-Fractions-directly-with-Python-OOPs
There is currently no direct way to work with Fractions in Python. The work is done by converting the Fraction to decimal and then perform operations. So I wanted to create a class whwre we can directly perform operations with Fractions. The code is not optimised for time complexity. It is just for a fun try and example for class & methods
